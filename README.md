#greg-client

### greg-client can do the following for you:
   
* manage Oxygen OAuth authentication 
* properly format and upload a package to the server
* properly format and upload a new package version to the server
* download a specific package header
* download a specific package body
* determine server connectivity

### greg-client doesn't do this for you:

* magically find all of the dependencies your package has (that's up to you)

### someday, reg-client will:
* zip up a collection of files to send by just providing the folder
