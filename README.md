#GRegClient 

# GRegClient is a client for the GReg package manager written in C#.

### greg-client can do the following for you:

* properly format and upload a package to the server
* properly format and upload a new package version to the server
* download a specific package header
* download a specific package body
* determine server connectivity

### greg-client doesn't do this for you:

* magically find all of the dependencies your package has (that's up to you)
